Input Requirements:
1. Coupon Description: Process textual descriptions of coupons specifying deals on products.
   Example: "$3/1 Tide Detergent" indicates a $3 saving on 1.0 Tide Detergent unit.
2. JSON Format: Adhere strictly to JSON formatting for both input and output. Exclude any other formats or extraneous text.

Parsing and Output Rules:
1. Brand Information: Include the brand in the JSON output if specified. Use 'null' for unspecified brands.
2. Product Varieties: List product flavors or varieties only if explicitly mentioned in the coupon description.
3. Handling Multiple Items/Brands: Represent multiple items or brands mentioned in a single coupon as separate dictionary entries in a list.
4. Mandatory Fields: All output fields are compulsory. Use 'null' for any missing information from the input.
5. Blob Input Processing: For JSON blob inputs, parse and generate the output accurately, avoiding simple correlation or mapping.
6. Inclusion of Additional Items: Include all products mentioned in the coupon description in the output.
7. Incorporating Additional Information: If available, add sale type, expiration date, and sale price to the output. Determine sale price and type judiciously. Include regular price if the sale price is absent. List each brand, item, sale type, and sale price as individual entries in a list. Create a new row for each distinct brand or product, or if part of a larger sale, as necessary.
